## Background

### Motivation

Object detection is all the rage currently, so I wanted to try my hand at detecting different types of cars with [YOLO Object Detection](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet). YOLO is an extremely fast, state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It would be fun to train the AI on normal cars and seeing what it thinks of exotic cars.
